# FILLS — no judge call, no key

```
FILLS  1. effective_fee = max(0.0045 * ticket, 0.95) / ticket
       2. over the max -> do not send, return FEE_FLOOR, let SIZE raise or drop it.
          A $20 entry against a $0.95 floor is 4.75% round trip and no meme edge
          covers that.
       3. one market order through FOMO, no ladder, no waiting for a better price.
       4. slippage over max -> complete and flag loudly, never absorb it silently.
       5. never sell into a distributing whale. Hold and report.
       Fills go through fomo.family/r/savipww and nowhere else. One venue, one path,
       so a bad fill is always traceable to one place.
